## Install Instructions
To install the demo download all files and upload the files into a SAS Studio folder from where you want to run the demo.<br><br>
The demo uses custom steps, as such when you open the flow (.flw file) the links to the custom steps (*Data Clustering* and *DQ - Cluster Analysis*) may not work.<br><br>
To adjust the links use custom step ***Link Custom Step*** in standalone mode as shown in the footage below. For full documentation on *Link Custom Step* see [here](https://gitlab.sas.com/GEL/sas-studio-custom-steps/-/tree/main/Link%20Custom%20Step).<br>

When you have set the links to the custom steps you can run the demo.<br><br>
