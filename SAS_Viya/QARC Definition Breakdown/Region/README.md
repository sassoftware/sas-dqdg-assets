# QKB Definitions by Region

The following QKB definitions are all exported from the CI33 QKB.  We have extracted out definitions by Region for those users who would like to import just a specific region based QKB into Viya as opposed to the entire CI33 QKB.  These files are provided as is.

File names for these QARC files are structured with QKBVersion_Region_Date, so the CI33_Asia_250730.qarc.
