# QKB Definitions by Language

The following QKB definitions are all exported from the CI33 QKB.  We have extracted out definitions by Language for those users who would like to import just a specific language based QKB into Viya as opposed to the entire CI33 QKB.  These files are provided as is.

File names for these QARC files are structured with QKBVersion_Language_Date, so the CI33_English_250730.qarc.
