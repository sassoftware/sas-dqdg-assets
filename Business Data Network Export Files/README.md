# SAS Business Data Network 

## Overview

SAS Business Data Network (BDN) is a tool that enables you to manage descriptions of business terms, including their requirements and attributes, related source data and reference data, contacts, and relationships between terms and processes. By linking terms to business rules and data monitoring processes, BDN provides an important starting point for data governance efforts. Data stewards, IT staff and enterprise architects can use the terms to promote a common vocabulary across projects and business units.

Out of the box the BDN does not have any data in the repository.  The following extracts can be imported into the BDN to give users a sense of how the tool can be set up.  Please note these two extracts are provided as is and are not products of R&D or Technical Support at SAS.
