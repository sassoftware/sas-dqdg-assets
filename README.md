# SAS Data Quality & Data Governance Repository

## Overview

This Data Quality (DQ) and Data Governance (DG) repository is meant to be a clearinghouse of SAS Viya and SAS9 resources.  Within this repository you will find many resources covering many different data quality and governance topics.  A few of these resources are:

 - (DataFlux) DM Studio jobs showing how to use: 
	 - Parsing, Standardization, Right Fielding, Loqate, Entity Resolution (match codes, clustering, survivorship)
	 - EEL code samples
	 - Process Job Samples
	 - Business Rules
	 - ...
 - SAS Studio Flows showing how to use:
	 - Clean and Parse data steps, Loqate, Entity Resolution (Match codes, clustering, survivorship)
	 - EEL code samples
	 - ID code samples
	 - Geocoding with PROC Geocode
	 - Data Masking
	 - DataFlux sample jobs that have been converted over to SAS Studio Flows
 - VA Reports
	 - Loqate
	 - Clustering
	 - Profiling
 - Business Data Network extracts
 - Custom QKB Definitions and QKBs
 - ...

This repository's goal is not just to put a job in a folder, but to put the sample data and PPT or readme file along with any other required resources so that users can get the job up and running for demos or personal training.
